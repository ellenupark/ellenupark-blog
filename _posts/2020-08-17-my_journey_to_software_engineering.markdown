I had one constant goal throughout my life. I wanted to move to New York and work in the fashion industry. Growing up, all my life choices were based around that fact. During college I remember seeing friends doing their computer science homework. To me, their screens looked like they were covered in some type of mysterious code. I always loved video games, and somehow that code became a game. It intrigued me. I wanted to understand it. 

Looking back now, I wish I had immediately pursued that interest in coding. But sadly, I did not. After college, I ended up living in Queens with three strangers I found online and interning at a fashion company. A few months after that I was hired and officially working in the industry. Up until that point in my life I had been fixated on reaching my goal. But, once I finally achieved it and started thinking about the next step, I felt lost. The longer I spent in the industry the more I realized it wasn't right for me. I couldn't see a future for myself.

I knew I had to make a change. Coding had always been at the back of my mind. And so, I began teaching myself. I studied coding problems on my commute and worked on Codecademy during my lunch break. I always enjoyed problem solving. My favorite part of working as a technical designer was analyzing and adjusting a gown until I reached the perfect fit. The creative freedom that was possible with coding appealed to me. I loved trying to find the most efficient and easily understandable solution to a problem. The more I learned about coding the more I wanted to expand my knowledge.

Now that I am finally at Flatiron and beginning my journey to a career in software engineering, I'm definitely nervous but also excited. But mainly, I'm relieved to be finally working towards a future I'm passionate about.
